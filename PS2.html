<p class="subTitle">Due on Canvas at 1:00pm on Monday, April 9th.</p>




<p class="projectName">Problem 1 (20 points)</p>
<p class="descriptionExtra">

The past few years have seen a number of privacy controversies related to transportation apps like Uber. For instance, Uber has made the news about <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ubers-god-view-was-once-available-to-drivers">God View mode</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/uber-should-restore-user-control-location-privacy">broad tracking of customers' location data</a>, and tracking users <a href="https://consumerist.com/2016/12/07/uber-tracks-you-even-after-your-ride-invasion-of-privacy-or-necessary/">after rides have ended</a>, <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/blog/why-privacy-advocates-are-worried-about-ubers-security-problems/">among other issues</a>.<br /><br />
Design a short (no more than 20-minute long) interview study exploring one or more research questions of interest to you in the area of security or privacy related to so-called "ride-sharing" apps. Potential topics include the convenience versus privacy tradeoff users perceive; awareness of these controversies; physical security concerns related to driving, or being driven around by, strangers; etc.
<br /><br />
Turn in a 1 paragraph description of your research question(s), along with the final script you use for the interview. Include in your script everything you will say to the participant at any point in the interview, such as welcoming them at the beginning or thanking them and telling them the purpose of the study.
